# Travelling-Salesman-Problem-Using-Branch-Bound
Imagine a salesman who needs to visit a set of cities and return to his starting point while minimizing the total distance traveled. 

City A to City B: 10 miles

City A to City C: 15 miles

City A to City D: 20 miles

City B to City C: 35 miles

City B to City D: 25 miles

City C to City D: 30 miles


The goal of the TSP is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.
